# Disclaimer
The creation and execution of this bot have been done with the direct negotiations of myself, Semlar, and DE. They are fully aware of what features Semlar and I have added and have the full details on how **we** are running it. Merely running this bot is a violation of the Warframe EULA and will likely yield undesirable results. This code is available primarily as a source of reference and as an example of my work.

You risk losing your account by attempting to run this or any other automation software against the game without talking to them about it first.

See sections 2.f, 2.h and 2.k of the [Warframe EULA](https://www.warframe.com/eula)
